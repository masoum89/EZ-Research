# EZ-Research
Easy research :D

What we share here?
===============
Here we share our information for better organization and furthur use. These information can be grouped as:
- **Surveys**: A survey about each subject that helps to start in this subject.
- **Materials**: Useful materials for a specific subject. e.g. A good *slide* or *tutorial* or *video lecture* or any other resources.

Structure
================
To respect discipline please consider following structure:
- Each subject is in a new *directory*
- In each directory we have multiple *sub directory* that helps better structure. Suggestion for sub directories are *Slide*, *Tutorial*, *Paper*, *Link*, ...
